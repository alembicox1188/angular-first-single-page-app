# angular-first-single-page-app
A very simple app which uses angular routing to be a single page app.

Angular made some version changes so now a second library is needed to enable routing.

The app loads two templates and declares a controller for each one.  

The links look like:

    <a href="#routeToPage">link text</a>

A permalink to the page could look like 

    http://blah.com/#/routeToPage
